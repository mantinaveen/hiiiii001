The term electronics is derived from the word “electrons”. Electronics is a branch of Physics that deals with the theory and use of devices in which the electrons travel through a vacuum, gas, or a semiconductor medium. The motion of electrons takes place under the influence of applied electric and/or magnetic fields.
